### Challenge 2: Double-Booking Prevention
**Problem:** Concurrent booking attempts  
**Solution:** Database-level indexing and server-side conflict checking before commit

### Challenge 3: Role-Based Navigation
**Problem:** Different users need different menu items  
**Solution:** Jinja2 conditional rendering based on `current_user.role`
